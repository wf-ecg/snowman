 * Shim for "fixing" IE's lack of support (IE < 9) for applying slice
 * on host objects like NamedNodeMap, NodeList, and HTMLCollection
 * (technically, since host objects have been implementation-dependent,
 * at least before ES6, IE hasn't needed to work this way).
 * Also works on strings, fixes IE < 9 to allow an explicit undefined
 * for the 2nd argument (as in Firefox), and prevents errors when
 * called on other DOM objects.
